				<h2><a href="/games/deltagreen/">Pok&eacute;mon Delta Green</a></h2>
				<p>Pokemon Delta Green is a game I have been working on for about 3 years now. It started out as an Idea to make a fan game. Look where I am now. Pokemon Delta Green puts you in the shoes of the main character, Delta. Like any other Pokemon Trainer, you start out when you are 10 years old, go to the lab, collect your pokemon, etc, etc. But along your adventures you meet an evil team. Know throughout the Shorebarrow Region as Team Titanium. Team Titanium's mission is to capture the three pokemon, Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza. Better known as the Weather Trio. Team Titanium has already capture Groudon and Kyogre. But there is one small problem. They have no way to summon Rayquaza. Oh, and you are another problem to them... Travel through the Shorebarrow Region and save Rayquaza, and the rest!</p>
