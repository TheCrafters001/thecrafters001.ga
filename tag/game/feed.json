            "content_html": "<p>Hello!</p>\n<p>I am happy to announce that I am working on a remastered version of Keep Control! <a id=\"more\"></a> If you don’t know what Keep Control is, it was a game I made for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam, with the theme of Out of Control. You can <a href=\"http://r.thecrafters001.ga/itch/GMTK-2020.html\">play it here</a>. Anyway, this remastered version of the game will feature a more complete storyline, and will also have a properly made character for the player. You, the player, have to find out how to get out of the game that you are trapped in. The way to do that is to get to the end of the game (duh) and to meet someone… <em>special</em>, shall I say. That is all I can say right now, because all I have is like 4 lines of dialog, and that is it. You can play the original game (linked above) to get an understanding of what it is. And yes, I do plan on making it longer that the one made for the Jam. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!</p>\n<p>Thanks for Reading!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Logo_Full.png\" alt=\"Logo\"></p>\n\n<div id=\"gitalk-container\"></div>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.bootcss.com/blueimp-md5/2.12.0/js/md5.min.js\"></script><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/gitalk/dist/gitalk.css\"><script src=\"https://unpkg.com/gitalk/dist/gitalk.min.js\"></script>\n\n\t\t<script>\n\t\tvar gitalkConfig = {\"clientID\":\"1ee99b59f661ba2c70d4\",\"clientSecret\":\"44379937dd4de9437db1c4d986ec7289ce69765e\",\"repo\":\"TheCrafters001\",\"owner\":\"TheCrafters001\",\"admin\":[\"TheCrafters001\"],\"distractionFreeMode\":false};\n\t    gitalkConfig.id = md5(location.pathname);\n\t\tvar gitalk = new Gitalk(gitalkConfig);\n\t    gitalk.render(\"gitalk-container\");\n\t    </script>",
