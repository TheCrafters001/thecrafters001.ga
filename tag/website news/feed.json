The link I gave leads back to that archive. 2018 is when I still was working hard on Delta Green, and TheCrafters001 OS. One of those doesn’t exist anymore, but what can I say. It was really more of what I am making with <a href=\"/software/forest-oe\">Forest-OE</a>. But, back to the post. I have added them back to my website in the <a href=\"/categories/Old-News/\">Old News catagory</a>. Anyway, that is all for this post.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Logo_Full_White.png\" alt=\"Logo\"></p>\n\n<div id=\"gitalk-container\"></div>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.bootcss.com/blueimp-md5/2.12.0/js/md5.min.js\"></script><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/gitalk/dist/gitalk.css\"><script src=\"https://unpkg.com/gitalk/dist/gitalk.min.js\"></script>\n\n\t\t<script>\n\t\tvar gitalkConfig = {\"clientID\":\"1ee99b59f661ba2c70d4\",\"clientSecret\":\"44379937dd4de9437db1c4d986ec7289ce69765e\",\"repo\":\"TheCrafters001\",\"owner\":\"TheCrafters001\",\"admin\":[\"TheCrafters001\"],\"distractionFreeMode\":true};\n\t    gitalkConfig.id = md5(location.pathname);\n\t\tvar gitalk = new Gitalk(gitalkConfig);\n\t    gitalk.render(\"gitalk-container\");\n\t    </script>",
