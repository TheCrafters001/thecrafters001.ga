The link I gave leads back to that archive. 2018 is when I still was working hard on Delta Green, and TheCrafters001 OS. One of those doesn’t exist anymore, but what can I say. It was really more of what I am making with <a href=\"/software/forest-oe\">Forest-OE</a>. But, back to the post. I have added them back to my website in the <a href=\"/categories/Old-News/\">Old News catagory</a>. Anyway, that is all for this post.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Logo_Full_White.png\" alt=\"Logo\"></p>\n",
