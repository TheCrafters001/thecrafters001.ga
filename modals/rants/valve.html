      <p>Look, I get that Valve is trying to get up with current trends, but this. This is just terrible. It is like they put 0 effort into their work. Steam was just fine the way it was. But, no. Valve thought it was a good idea to up and change. Personally, I hate it. I hate all of it. I hate the current trends websites are now taking on. Everything is trying to copy Microsoft and Google, with Metro and Material Design. I personally think that everyone should STOP! There are plenty, and I mean plenty, of things in the world that work just fine, and then the company who makes the thing SCREWS IT ALL UP! Looking at you Microsoft. You can't even fix the BIGGEST feature that helps us keep us safe on today's internet. I am talking about the one, the only, Windows Update.</p>
      <p>I can't even get the settings app to work the way I want it to. The fact of the matter is, companies just need to STOP COPING COMPANIES. If you think you should switch over to material design, or the metro style... Don't. It is not worth it. Maintaining that level of garbage, slow code is not worth it. So please, PLEASE, don't follow what these companies are doing. I am sure that @Tricky could agree with me... Maybe. <br> Me, I HATE COMPANIES. Just stop. making. garbage, slow. code. that. makes. me. hate. your. products.</p>
