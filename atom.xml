    <title>My View on the New FTC Law</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So… The time has finally come that YouTube could die.<a id="more"></a> All because they decided to break the law, and open their mouth. This would have never of happened if they said nothing. All YouTube had to do was just sit and stay quite. Nope. They thought it was a good idea to say that they were purposefully showing targeted ads to kids. Who would of thought? And this “Age Rating System” they came up with, is ALSO ignoring the law. On Purpose. Because they say they will not make enough money if they include what is said in the law.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/pwnvjuCTb54" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>The law states that there IS a middle ground. There is a General Audience Exception. In. The. LAW. But YouTube ignored it. And for content creators who think that moving to a new platform, like <a href="https://vlare.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vlare</a> or <a href="https://vimeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vimeo</a>, think again. Whatever the law says, and someone makes something similar to the thing, the law follows. COPPA is not just confined to YouTube, it is confined to EVERYONE. There is no stopping the law.<br>Now, I should not be affected too much, as I target people over 13, and the fact that I don’t use cookies to collect information on people, and I don’t track people on my apps. But if the law says no, they say no. I have never had ADS on my website, never will. Hence my slogan, “Redefining Free.” But if the government has people that LITERALLY DON’T HAVE CELLPHONES, they you guys are in trouble, no matter what.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/pd604xskDmU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>My advice? Stop Targeted Ads; Stop Tracking Cookies.<br>I am now going to leave some videos on peoples thoughts on the matter.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/pd604xskDmU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/pwnvjuCTb54" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0veLrwd9CK4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/b8y1KGIQ6KU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PQjj2nOwhO8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/TIBlcKAfy-4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is regarding the next update in Pokemon Delta Green.<br>If you think this post is about how it is not going to be finished, your are very wrong. I have been working on this project for OVER 3 years now. I am not going to drop it just like that.</p><p>I want to say that the update may not be done for a while, as I am going to be working on a lot of bug fixes, story elements, and grammar/typo fixes. That means I am going to go through map by map and fix any issues with the dialog. I am also going to be going through and redesigning maps. This will have some-what of an effect on the story, because I may alter it to fit the town you are in.<br>That means I am also going to be working on the Gym Leaders. I will be working on their personalities this update. This way you can feel more attached to them. But before I start any of this, I am going to take a break. I will resume some time in December, after the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameOff Game Jam 2019</a> voting ends.</p>]]></content>
