    <h1>Reviews are going away from me.</h1>
    <div class="meta"><b>Posted on 10/29/2020  7:01 AM by TheCrafters001</b></div>
    <div class="fullpost"><p>I know that I just added the reviews page for my site, but I am getting rid of it completely, as I do not want to review anything anymore. Know why? Scoring stuff is stupid. I won't miss reviews, but I am not going to do them anymore because scoring stuff can really make an impact on how someone sees something, and, if I say something that "<strong>hurts</strong>" someone, they will then start making comments on how that "<strong>Oh, YoU gAvE bLaNk A bAd ScOrE bEcAuSe YoU aRe NoT gOoD aT tHe GaMe</strong>" or "<strong>Oh, YoU gAvE bLaNk A bAd ScOrE bEcAuSe YoU aRe NoT gOoD aT uSiNg ThE sOfTwArE</strong>" and you know what? No body should feel attacked based on <strong>PERSONAL OPINION</strong>! Heck, even someone I watch said they are ditching their scoring system entirely. That video will be put at the end for you to watch, but I think he makes a ton of great points. Anyways, I have gotten rid of the reviews on my site already, if you can't tell. I just don't care for them anymore. Back when I reviewed games a long time ago (at least back in 2018), I only ever made 4 reviews before I shutdown that site. Why? Because I got old, real fast. I know there are people who like reviewing games, heck it is even their job (IGN), and I think that is a good job to have, but a lot of the time, most people just look at the score, and just say "This game looks good" or "7.8/10?! This game must be awful." And that is exactly what happens. I don't look at the score, or even the review. And, even if I do look at the score, I say "Okay, so this person gave it a 7/10. So they like it, but they think it could be just a little better." I never go on and email them claiming that their opinion is wrong. And a lot of the time, people also expect for them to update their reviews when a DLC drops. I have never seen that happen. Just because Pok√©mon Sword was very lackluster, doesn't mean the DLCs are going to make it better. Now, I am going to leave you off with this: If you are going to buy something, and look at the review, and that review is terrible, buy the game anyways, you may be surprised at what <strong>YOU</strong> like. That is all for now. Thanks for reading. - TheCrafters001 Here is that video I talked about before before. </p><iframe class="ql-video" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lgL8TFQmrFk"></iframe></div>
