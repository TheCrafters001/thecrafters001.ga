                <p>Hi! I am super happy to show you something I have made.</p>

<p>My old logo was just plain and simple. Nothing wrong with it, I think just plain text got a little boring. I mean, here. Look at this.</p>
<div class="gallery"   >
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://thecrafters001.ga/media/posts/37/gallery/TC001.png" ><img src="https://thecrafters001.ga/media/posts/37/gallery/TC001-thumbnail.png" alt="WhiteText" width="500" height="200"></a>

<figcaption>Old Black Logo</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Does it not look boring? So, I have made a new one! Have a look.</p>
<p><img class="post__image post__image--center" src="https://thecrafters001.ga/media/posts/37/Logo_Full.png" alt="TheCrafters001 Logo" width="600" height="300">I find it much better than just some text. While, yes, I am using the same font, I have changed it up a bit. I have updated my website to fit these changes, even the icon in the tab has change! I am happy with this change, but hey, I like it. You may hate it, I don't care if you do. I am keeping it like this for a while, so... sorry if you hate it.</p>

                <p>So, I am sorry to say this, but after long consideration, I have decided to kill off TheCrafters001 Direct</p>

<p>The reason being is that I never really updated it. But hey, I am going to look on the bright side, I am learning <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and am going to learn how to use <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> using a couple of tutorials on YouTube. Specifically the "<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSHL_lYY_Xc" rel="nofollow ugc">Node.js A to Z</a></em>" by <a href="james murphy" rel="nofollow ugc">James Murphy</a> and the "<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw" rel="nofollow ugc">Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners</a></em>" by <a href="http://freecodecamp.org" rel="nofollow ugc">freeCodeCamp.org</a>. But until I complete them, you are just going to have to live with my VB.NET software, sorry.</p>

                I have decided to reset the "The Adventure of Block" project.
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e852mhdc0">Reason</h2>
<p>The reason why I have decided to do this, is because I am not very good at makeing assets for RPG Maker MV. I will use a lot of the default RPG Maker MV envirement sprites, but I will use some of my custom assets.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>However, the current demo is still avaliable to play.</p>
<p>You can play it on the Games page.</p>
