                I have decided to reset the "The Adventure of Block" project.
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e852mhdc0">Reason</h2>
<p>The reason why I have decided to do this, is because I am not very good at makeing assets for RPG Maker MV. I will use a lot of the default RPG Maker MV envirement sprites, but I will use some of my custom assets.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>However, the current demo is still avaliable to play.</p>
<p>You can play it on the Games page.</p>

<p >Hi! I want you to come up with a team to be put into Delta Green!</p>
<p>Your team has to be under these guidelines, however.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You must not have your team over lvl 70.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can have all 6 pokemon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NO LEGENDARIES OR MYTHICAL POKEMON.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can create a custom sprite using the one below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must state what trainer class you are (custom classes can be considered)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of limits in the editor, IVs can be edited, but EVs cannot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must state what gender your Pokemon are (makes it easier on my life)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is about it. No custom types are available in the game, and you are limited to pokemon from Gen 1 to Gen 5. This also means that Fairy type does not exist.</p>
<p>Happy Team Building!</p>
