                <p>Hi. I will be redoing some of the page structuring for the website. Mainly these changes will only effect software and game pages, not post. The first changes are to the Navigation Bar and to the Software page. Other changes that are coming will also be listed here.</p>
<h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
<p>The navigation bar will be updated to more fit a format that is easier for me people to understand. While not all changes will go into effect instantly, it will still have some changes.</p>
<h2>Software Page</h2>
<p>The software page will now be split up into categories, the "Solo Programs" category, and a series category.</p>
<h2>Game Page</h2>
<p>The game page will get a similar treatment to the software page, but instead of "Solo Programs" and a series category, they will get the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original Game</li>
<li>Fan-Game</li>
<li>Jam-Game</li>
</ul>
<h2>Blog Structure</h2>
<p>You may have already noticed that the way that the post are displayed on a page has been changed, that was the first step, but now I have finished with those changes.</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>If you have questions, feel free to <a href="https://thecrafters001.ga/contact-me/">contact me</a>, or visit the Q&amp;A section on each page.</p>

<p>What does he eat? I mean, he is a snake. While you may think he is like a corn snake, or something. He is not, he really doesn't eat anything. Um... Yeah. I know Kattu is kinda a weird color, but that doesn't bother him. Kattu is just a nice little snake. :D</p>
<p>So... Yeah. Kattu. The EasyInno Snake.</p>

                <p>Hi! I am super happy to show you something I have made.</p>

<p>My old logo was just plain and simple. Nothing wrong with it, I think just plain text got a little boring. I mean, here. Look at this.</p>

<p>Does it not look boring? So, I have made a new one! Have a look.</p>

While, yes, I am using the same font, I have changed it up a bit. I have updated my website to fit these changes, even the icon in the tab has change! I am happy with this change, but hey, I like it. You may hate it, I don't care if you do. I am keeping it like this for a while, so... sorry if you hate it.</p>

                <p>So, I am sorry to say this, but after long consideration, I have decided to kill off TheCrafters001 Direct</p>

<p>The reason being is that I never really updated it. But hey, I am going to look on the bright side, I am learning <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and am going to learn how to use <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> using a couple of tutorials on YouTube. Specifically the "<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSHL_lYY_Xc" rel="nofollow ugc">Node.js A to Z</a></em>" by <a href="james murphy" rel="nofollow ugc">James Murphy</a> and the "<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw" rel="nofollow ugc">Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners</a></em>" by <a href="http://freecodecamp.org" rel="nofollow ugc">freeCodeCamp.org</a>. But until I complete them, you are just going to have to live with my VB.NET software, sorry.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1e852mhdc0">Reason</h2>
<p>The reason why I have decided to do this, is because I am not very good at makeing assets for RPG Maker MV. I will use a lot of the default RPG Maker MV envirement sprites, but I will use some of my custom assets.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>However, the current demo is still avaliable to play.</p>
<p>You can play it on the Games page.</p>
