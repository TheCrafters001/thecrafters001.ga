                <p>Hi! I am super happy to show you something I have made.</p>

<p>My old logo was just plain and simple. Nothing wrong with it, I think just plain text got a little boring. I mean, here. Look at this.</p>
<div class="gallery"   >
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://thecrafters001.ga/media/posts/37/gallery/TC001.png" ><img src="https://thecrafters001.ga/media/posts/37/gallery/TC001-thumbnail.png" alt="WhiteText" width="500" height="200"></a>

<figcaption>Old Black Logo</figcaption>

</div>
<p>Does it not look boring? So, I have made a new one! Have a look.</p>
<p><img class="post__image post__image--center" src="https://thecrafters001.ga/media/posts/37/Logo_Full.png" alt="TheCrafters001 Logo" width="600" height="300">I find it much better than just some text. While, yes, I am using the same font, I have changed it up a bit. I have updated my website to fit these changes, even the icon in the tab has change! I am happy with this change, but hey, I like it. You may hate it, I don't care if you do. I am keeping it like this for a while, so... sorry if you hate it.</p>

But until I complete them, you are just going to have to live with my VB.NET software, sorry.</p>
<p>But with python I can make neat little applications. Don't judge me for the code below, as I am just learning the language.</p>
<p><code>user_age = input("Enter your age: ")<br>user_name = input("Enter your name: ")<br>print("Hi, " + user_name + "! You are " + user_age + "-years-old")</code></p>
<p>This currently is my most basic understanding of Python.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I'm working on it.</p>

                I have decided to reset the "The Adventure of Block" project.
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e852mhdc0">Reason</h2>
<p>The reason why I have decided to do this, is because I am not very good at makeing assets for RPG Maker MV. I will use a lot of the default RPG Maker MV envirement sprites, but I will use some of my custom assets.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>However, the current demo is still avaliable to play.</p>
<p>You can play it on the Games page.</p>
