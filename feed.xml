<p>This year has been hard for many people. There is no denying that. Not everyone got COVID-19, but my heart goes out to those who were. And I would like to say, thank you, everyone. For everything that everyone has done to help make the Internet a better place throughout this whole Pandemic.</p>
<p>The TF2 Community is still in shock over what happened to Rick May. For those who don't know, Rick May was the voice of Soldier in a game called Team Fortress 2. He passed away due to COVID-19 on April 13th, 2020.</p>
<p>This year has been hard. Here is to a better year next year.</p>

                <p>Hi. Me again. I know that this site seems a bit... well... very different.</p>

<p>That is because I actually swapped back to Publii (god, I need to find a solution and stick with it). Anyways... this is my new website. It looks very different. I really want to make my own theme for Publii, but I don't know how, as the code is confusing to look at. Anyways... yeah. That is about it. Right now this is the only thing on the website, aside from one other page, but I kinda need that one.</p>
