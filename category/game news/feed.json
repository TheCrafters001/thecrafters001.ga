            "content_html": "<p>Hello!</p>\n<p>I am happy to announce that I am working on a remastered version of Keep Control! If you don’t know what Keep Control is, it was a game I made for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam, with the theme of Out of Control. You can <a href=\"http://r.thecrafters001.ga/itch/GMTK-2020.html\">play it here</a>. Anyway, this remastered version of the game will feature a more complete storyline, and will also have a properly made character for the player. You, the player, have to find out how to get out of the game that you are trapped in. The way to do that is to get to the end of the game (duh) and to meet someone… <em>special</em>, shall I say. That is all I can say right now, because all I have is like 4 lines of dialog, and that is it. You can play the original game (linked above) to get an understanding of what it is. And yes, I do plan on making it longer that the one made for the Jam. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!</p>\n<p>Thanks for Reading!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Logo_Full.png\" alt=\"Logo\"></p>\n\n<div id=\"gitalk-container\"></div>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.bootcss.com/blueimp-md5/2.12.0/js/md5.min.js\"></script><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/gitalk/dist/gitalk.css\"><script src=\"https://unpkg.com/gitalk/dist/gitalk.min.js\"></script>\n\n\t\t<script>\n\t\tvar gitalkConfig = {\"clientID\":\"1ee99b59f661ba2c70d4\",\"clientSecret\":\"44379937dd4de9437db1c4d986ec7289ce69765e\",\"repo\":\"TheCrafters001\",\"owner\":\"TheCrafters001\",\"admin\":[\"TheCrafters001\"],\"distractionFreeMode\":false};\n\t    gitalkConfig.id = md5(location.pathname);\n\t\tvar gitalk = new Gitalk(gitalkConfig);\n\t    gitalk.render(\"gitalk-container\");\n\t    </script>",

            "content_html": "<p>So… This is a question that has been bothering me for a while. Pokémon Fan Games are hard to make. But I am not making a ROM hack, so why is it taking so long? First is the fact that we really don’t have a story. I mean, the story we <em><strong>DO</strong></em> have is only one and a half pages long. But that is not the only thing that we are tring to figure out, we just also ended up to make the starter (not starters) an Eevee. Don’t beleave me? Here is a snippet of code from the game:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">@&gt;Text: \\bBut I do have one left. I think it will make a good </span><br><span class=\"line\">:     : partner for you! Here you go!</span><br><span class=\"line\">@&gt;Script: pbAddPokemon(:EEVEE,5)</span><br><span class=\"line\">@&gt;Control Switches: [0076: NoPokemonSelected] &#x3D; OFF</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now, you may have noticed that I keep saying “we” in the post. I am refering to me and Frozentual. Frozentual is the person who builds the trainers’ teams in the game. But if you couldn’t tell, we have no idea what we are doing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>HOW TO WRITE SCRTIPT FOR POKMONE GAME<br>?!<br>I ASM SO CIKNFUYSED</p>\n<footer><strong>@Frozentual</strong><cite><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Frozentual/status/1299441089233981440\">twitter.com/Frozentual/status/1299441089233981440</a></cite></footer></blockquote>\n\n<p>Another thing.<br>We are also using a Game Engine that, while it is popular for making fan-games, is hardly used for game development anymore. Don’t get me wrong, <a href=\"https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-xp\">RPG Maker XP</a> is a good engine, it is just… “old”. <a href=\"https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-mz\">Especially now that the new version of RPG Maker just came out on the 20th</a>. But hey. I like the engine. And now I think it is time to end the post because I am running out of things to talk about.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading.<br><img src=\"/images/Logo_Full.png\" alt=\"Logo\"></p>\n\n<div id=\"gitalk-container\"></div>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.bootcss.com/blueimp-md5/2.12.0/js/md5.min.js\"></script><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/gitalk/dist/gitalk.css\"><script src=\"https://unpkg.com/gitalk/dist/gitalk.min.js\"></script>\n\n\t\t<script>\n\t\tvar gitalkConfig = {\"clientID\":\"1ee99b59f661ba2c70d4\",\"clientSecret\":\"44379937dd4de9437db1c4d986ec7289ce69765e\",\"repo\":\"TheCrafters001\",\"owner\":\"TheCrafters001\",\"admin\":[\"TheCrafters001\"],\"distractionFreeMode\":false};\n\t    gitalkConfig.id = md5(location.pathname);\n\t\tvar gitalk = new Gitalk(gitalkConfig);\n\t    gitalk.render(\"gitalk-container\");\n\t    </script>",
