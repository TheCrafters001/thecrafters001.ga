The link I gave leads back to that archive. 2018 is when I still was working hard on Delta Green, and TheCrafters001 OS. One of those doesn’t exist anymore, but what can I say. It was really more of what I am making with <a href=\"/software/forest-oe\">Forest-OE</a>. But, back to the post. I have added them back to my website in the <a href=\"/categories/Old-News/\">Old News catagory</a>.

            "content_html": "<p>So… This is a question that has been bothering me for a while. Pokémon Fan Games are hard to make. But I am not making a ROM hack, so why is it taking so long? First is the fact that we really don’t have a story. I mean, the story we <em><strong>DO</strong></em> have is only one and a half pages long. But that is not the only thing that we are tring to figure out, we just also ended up to make the starter (not starters) an Eevee. Don’t beleave me? Here is a snippet of code from the game:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">@&gt;Text: \\bBut I do have one left. I think it will make a good </span><br><span class=\"line\">:     : partner for you! Here you go!</span><br><span class=\"line\">@&gt;Script: pbAddPokemon(:EEVEE,5)</span><br><span class=\"line\">@&gt;Control Switches: [0076: NoPokemonSelected] &#x3D; OFF</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now, you may have noticed that I keep saying “we” in the post. I am refering to me and Frozentual. Frozentual is the person who builds the trainers’ teams in the game. But if you couldn’t tell, we have no idea what we are doing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>HOW TO WRITE SCRTIPT FOR POKMONE GAME<br>?!<br>I ASM SO CIKNFUYSED</p>\n<footer><strong>@Frozentual</strong><cite><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Frozentual/status/1299441089233981440\">twitter.com/Frozentual/status/1299441089233981440</a></cite></footer></blockquote>\n\n<p>Another thing.<br>We are also using a Game Engine that, while it is popular for making fan-games, is hardly used for game development anymore. Don’t get me wrong, <a href=\"https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-xp\">RPG Maker XP</a> is a good engine, it is just… “old”. <a href=\"https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-mz\">Especially now that the new version of RPG Maker just came out on the 20th</a>. But hey. I like the engine. And now I think it is time to end the post because I am running out of things to talk about.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading.<br><img src=\"/images/Logo_Full_White.png\" alt=\"Logo\"></p>\n",
