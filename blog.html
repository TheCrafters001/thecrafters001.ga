            <div class="summary"><p>The Pokémon Presents was a big disappointment today. :|<br>
It is all info that we already knew.<br>
I don't think the Presents was good, at all. The only thing good that came out was this.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Serebii Update: It is confirmed that Pokémon Sword & Shield Crown Tundra contains a new item, the Ability Patch, that allows for you to change a Pokémon's ability to its Hidden Ability <a href="https://t.co/gDbXkHSvkT">https://t.co/gDbXkHSvkT</a> <a href="https://t.co/sLAxi0H2lL">pic.twitter.com/sLAxi0H2lL</a></p>— Serebii.net (@SerebiiNet) <a href="https://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/1310932041278554114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

            <h3>GameJolt Drama</h3>
            <div class="meta">Posted on 09/28/2020  8:54 PM by TheCrafters001</div>
            <div class="summary"><p>So. GameJolt has been having a lot of "drama" recently. I won't get into the details, and I am not going to say what users are involved, but I do think it needs to stop. All of this is just crazy, and I want it to stop. GameJolt is just a place for people to have fun, play games, and develop them, all with a loving community. I hate that the GameJolt Moderators are having to deal with all of this in the time of a pandemic, not only that, but things are just getting out of hand. One user on the site put it as</p><blockquote>I really, REALLY don't like having to use my platform this way, to call specific people out, but enough is enough. I've had it with the toxicity in this community and I am VERY disappointed! - <strong>Anonymous (For user's privacy)</strong></blockquote><p>I agree with this. I even made a comment on the post, and he agree with most of what I had to say. I just don't want to see this kind of crap anymore. Pardon my language, but it's true. I have seen users leave the site over this ordeal, and I hate to see it. Many accounts are going in-active just because of everything going on. I don't want to join that group. I like the site, and I hate that this is happening. So please, with all the kindness from my heart, please stop fighting, or causing controversy. It annoys users like me, any many others.</p></div>

            <h3>Updated Software and Games Pages</h3>
            <div class="meta">Posted on 09/28/2020  3:58 PM by TheCrafters001</div>
            <div class="summary"><p>So, I updated the Software and Game Pages to make them fit the style of the website, I have removed the broken links. So Yay! As for the comments, <s>I added the code for them in, but I have no idea if it is working because they won't appear on the local server that VAPID runs.</s></p><p>Edit: It works, I just put the code in the wrong order.</p></div>

            <h3>Ugh! Another Website Update?!</h3>
            <div class="meta">Posted on 09/28/2020 12:28 PM by TheCrafters001</div>
            <div class="summary"><p>Yeah, I updated the website design again. However I have WAY more control over what I can do. I know it is annoying to have to deal with the website changing every three months, but I am happy with the way that <a href="http://vapid.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vapid</a> generates the site! So I think this will be the final design for a while.</p></div>
